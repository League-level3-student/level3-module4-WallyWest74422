package _02_IntroToQueues;
/* 
 * OBJECTIVE:
 * 1. Push 100 double values onto a Stack.
 * 2. Pop off as many values from the Stack to fill a Queue with 5 values.
 * 3. Randomly remove between 1 and 5 values from the Queue and print them to
 *    the console.
 * 4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until there are no values left in either the Stack
 *    or Queue.
 * 
 * Example:
 * stack: { ..., 60, 36, 88, 4, 65, 75, 10 }
 * queue: { } // empty
 * 
 * Pop off 5 elements from stack to fill queue with 5 elements
 * stack: { ..., 60, 36 }
 * queue: { 10, 75, 65, 4, 88 }
 * 
 * Remove a random number of values from the front of the queue
 * (2 in this example) and print the number of values being removed
 * and the values themselves
 * stack: { ..., 60, 36 }
 * queue: { 65, 4, 88 }
 * "Removing 2 elements: 10 75"
 * 
 * Pop off 2 elements from the stack to fill the queue to 5
 * stack: { ... }
 * queue: { 65, 4, 88, 36, 60 }
 * 
 * Repeat until there are no more elements in the stack and queue
