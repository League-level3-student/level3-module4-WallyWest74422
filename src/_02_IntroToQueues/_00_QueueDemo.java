         * A Queue is a data structure that maintains the order of the objects
         * added to it. It's similar to a Stack except the Queue removes
         * the "oldest" object first instead of the "newest" object.
         * For example, if 3 String objects are added to a Queue,
         * ArrayDeque<String> myQueue = new ArrayDeque<String>();
         * myQueue.add("A");                  // oldest object added
         * myQueue.add("B");
         * myQueue.add("C");                  // newest object added
         * String head = myQueue.remove()     // returns "A" and the Queue
         *                                    // size is decreased by 1 
         * the String "A" is removed from the queue when the remove() method
         * is called. Just like a Stack, even if the return value of the
         * remove() method is not stored in a variable, the size of the queue
         * is still decreased by 1 whenever remove() is called.
         * 
         * The oldest object added to a Queue is called the 'front' or 'head'
         * of the Queue. The most recent object added to a Queue is called the
         * "back" or "tail" of the Queue. Similar to a Stack, adding and
         * removing objects from the middle of a Queue is not typically
         * allowed. This maintains the order of the Queue where the first
         * object added is the first object out of the Queue. This ordering is
         * called First In First Out, or FIFO for short.
         *      add to back+           +front (next to be removed)
         *                 |           |
         *                  "C" "B" "A"
