/*
 * OBJECTIVE:
 * Complete the calculateWaitTime() method to return the amount of time it
 * takes to get the tickets.
 *  
 * You managed to send your friend to queue for tickets in your stead, but
 * there is a catch: he will get there only if you tell him how much that is
 * going to take. And everybody can only take ONE TICKET at a time, then they
 * go back in the last position of the queue if they need more (or go home if
 * they are fine).
 * 
 * Each ticket takes one minutes to emit with no wasted time between purchases.
 * You will be given a queue with all the people queuing and the initial
 * position of your buddy.
 * 
 * Example:
 * queue: [2, 5, 3, 4, 6]
 * position: 1 (the person who wants to buy 5 tickets)
 * 
 * The first person buys 1 ticket then moves to the back of the queue because
 * they still need to buy 1 more ticket. Everyone else moves up the queue.
 * queue: [5, 3, 4, 6, 1]
 * 
 * Now it's your turn to buy a ticket. You buy 1 and move to the back of the
 * queue because you still need to buy 4 more
 * queue: [3, 4, 6, 1, 4]
 *
 * For this queue it takes a total of 18 minutes!
